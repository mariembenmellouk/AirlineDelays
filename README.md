This project demonstrates the development of an MLProject pipeline that processes data in three main stages:

1- Data Cleaning: Loading raw data, handling missing values, and renaming columns to create a clean dataset.
2- Data Filtering: Filtering the cleaned data to focus on specific subsets (e.g., JFK departures).
3- Data Modeling: Applying a machine learning model (polynomial regression) to make predictions based on the filtered data.
